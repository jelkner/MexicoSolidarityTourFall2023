José Luis Granados is an experienced Mexican-Canadian freelance journalist
based in Mexico City. He has worked throughout Latin America as both a writer
and election observation specialist, including a stint as a member of the
Canadian electoral mission in the 2009 Presidential Election in El Salvador and
as an ethno-cultural outreach officer for Elections Canada for the 2011 federal
election. More recently he observed the 2018 Presidential Election in Mexico
where he was responsible for the English-language communication strategy for
the The Scholar and Citizen Network for Democracy, an independent observation
mission led by Dr. John Ackerman. José Luis has worked on developing
international solidarity with countries of the global South since his first
visit to Venezuela in 2005 and he has since travelled to the country on several
occasions to further develop ties with the peoples of Venezuela through the
Norman Bethune Front. José Luis is fluent in both English and Spanish.
