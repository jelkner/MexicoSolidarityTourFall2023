# Web Documents for Mexico Solidarity Tour Fall 2023

## Goals

* To bring factual information from on-the-ground social movement activists in
  México, providing a counter narrative to the "news" in the mainstream press
* To share lessons from the electoral victories of Morena
* To argue for the strategic importance of solidarity between Mexican and US
  activists. As anti-imperialists, we must prevent the US from denying Mexico's
  sovereignty required to complete its transformation into a nation that
  prioritizes the needs of working people, and to recognize that Mexico's
  success can help US left/progressives move our own transformational agenda.
* To promote the México Solidarity Project and encourage people to subscribe to
  our Bulletin
